0.9.0 --> 0.9.1
===============

* Upgrade to haskell-src-exts 1.11. Only change is to add a Just constructor
  in Trhsx to the fixities used when parsing, to retain the previous behavior.


0.8.0 --> 0.9.0
===============

* Several small changes relating to upgrades to use type equality constraints.


0.7.0 --> 0.8.0
===============

* Introduce the new child tag syntax available with haskell-src-exts 1.10.x:

	<%><foo/>bar</%> 
  
  now translates into the equivalent of 

	asChild [asChild <foo/>, asChild "bar"]

  (though of course with appropriate translation of the <foo/> component as well).


0.6.1 --> 0.7.0
===============

* Give PCDATA children special treatment in the XMLGenerator translations. This is to
  avoid situations where GHC has too little information to pick the correct instances,
  and if the only children it sees are PCDATA strings then it defaults to (XML m ~ String).
  Strings can now never be the XML type of any generator, but chances are fairly small
  that anyone ever wanted that anyway. It also means that there is always a default
  instance for EmbedAsChild for literal strings.

* Fix a bug with an erroneous parenthesis in the output of trhsx { (map (asAttr x)) instead
  of the correct (map asAttr x) }.

* Import OldException on newer versions of base.

* Add mapXMLGenT to XMLGenerator, to allow mapping over the inner monad of a generator.

* Slight change to the format of error messages, to make them emacs-friendly.

0.6.0 --> 0.6.1
===============

* Upgrade to haskell-src-exts 1.5. Only change is to set the parsing to ignore LINE pragmas.

0.5.5 --> 0.6.0
===============

* Upgrade to haskell-src-exts 1.4. A lot of added cases in the AST traversal, but 
  nothing that would really warrant the major version number bump. Still, it feels better this
  way, to get a fresh start with the new HSE versions.
