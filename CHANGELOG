0.6.0 --> 0.6.1
===============

* Upgrade to haskell-src-exts 1.5. Only change is to set the parsing to ignore LINE pragmas.

0.5.5 --> 0.6.0
===============

* Upgrade to haskell-src-exts 1.4. A lot of added cases in the AST traversal, but 
  nothing that would really warrant the major version number bump. Still, it feels better this
  way, to get a fresh start with the new HSE versions.
